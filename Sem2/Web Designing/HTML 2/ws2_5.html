Use <mark>strong</mark> when you need to indicate the <mark>importance</mark> of a piece of text, such as an error or warning message,<br>
and <mark>em</mark> should be for adding <mark>emphasis</mark> to text, stressing words to adapt the meaning of a sentence.<br><br>
 
<mark>Mark</mark> differs from these two as it is used purely for <mark>highlighting</mark> the relevance of a piece of text to the<br>
user and/or page's content.In the past, you may have used <mark>em</mark> and <mark>strong</mark> for this purpose,which was arguably valid<br>
at the time due to the lack of a better element,but the introduction of <mark>mark</mark> simply means their use will be more strict.<br>
