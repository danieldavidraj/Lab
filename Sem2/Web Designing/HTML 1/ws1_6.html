<font face="Times New Roman">In linguistics, an adjective(abbreviated adj)is a word whose main role is to modify/describe</font><br><br>
<font face="Courier">a noun or noun phrase. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.</font><br><br>
<font face="Comic sans MS">Adjectives are one of the main parts of speech of the English language,</font><br><br>
<font face="Verdana">although historically they were classed together with nouns.</font><br><br>
<font face="Bedrock">Certain words that were traditionally considered to be adjectives,</font><br><br> 
<font face="Helvetica">including the, this, my, etc., are today usually classed separately, as determiners.</font>
