<font face="Comic sans MS" size="6" color="Red">In linguistics, an adjective(abbreviated adj)is a word whose main role is to modify/describe<br />
a noun or noun phrase. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.<br />
Adjectives are one of the main parts of speech of the English language,<br />
although historically they were classed together with nouns.<br />
Certain words that were traditionally considered to be adjectives,<br /> 
including the, this, my, etc., are today usually classed separately, as determiners.</font>
